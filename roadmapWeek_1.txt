🌟 AI Challenge Week 1: Foundation Building (Day 1–7)
Goal: Learn basic Python programming and essential math (linear algebra, probability, and calculus intro).

✅ Day 1: Python Basics I – Syntax & Variables
Learn:

Variables, Data Types (int, float, string, bool)

Input/Output

Basic Operators (+, -, *, /, **, //, %)

Practice:

Simple calculator

Swap two numbers

Resource: Programiz Python Tutorial

✅ Day 2: Python Basics II – Control Flow
Learn:

if, else, elif

Logical and Comparison Operators

Practice:

Grade checker

Even/odd, positive/negative

Mini challenge: Write a number guessing game.

✅ Day 3: Python Loops and Functions
Learn:

for and while loops

break, continue

Functions: def, parameters, return values

Practice:

Factorial calculator

Fibonacci generator

Mini challenge: Prime number checker using function.

✅ Day 4: Python Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
Learn:

List operations (append, pop, slice)

Tuples (immutability)

Dictionaries (key-value pairs)

Practice:

Student grade storage system

Simple contact book

Extra: Practice with nested loops and lists.

✅ Day 5: Math for AI – Linear Algebra Basics
Learn:

Scalars, Vectors, Matrices

Matrix addition, scalar multiplication

Dot product

Tool: Use NumPy for basic vector/matrix operations

Practice:

Represent 2D vectors

Calculate vector magnitude and dot product

✅ Day 6: Math for AI – Probability & Statistics Basics
Learn:

Mean, Median, Mode

Probability basics (independent events, conditional prob.)

Practice:

Dice and card problems

Write Python code to calculate average from a list of numbers.

✅ Day 7: Recap + Build Mini Project
Review all topics

Project Idea: "Simple Student Analyzer"

Takes marks as input

Uses a dictionary to store student info

Calculates average, grade, and gives remarks

Uses conditions, loops, functions

🔧 Tools to Use:
IDE: Replit or VS Code

Math Reference: Khan Academy – Linear Algebra & Probability

Python Practice: HackerRank Python Challenges

🔁 Your Task:
✅ Stick to daily learning + coding for 2–3 hours.

🧠 Keep a daily log (you can even post on Twitter or a notebook).

📅 Come back on Day 7 night or Day 8 morning for Week 2 roadmap!
