Machine Learning Learning Roadmap for Sandesh (PDF Outline)
Phase 1: Foundation (Beginner Level)
Duration: 1-2 Months
Math Topics:

Basic Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, dot products

Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, variance, standard deviation

Probability: Basics, normal distribution

Python Libraries:

NumPy (numerical operations)

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (basic ML models)

Projects:

Data Cleaning & EDA:

Clean datasets (e.g., Titanic, Iris).

Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots).

Simple ML Models:

Linear regression (predict housing prices).

Classification (Iris species/Titanic survival).

Goal:

Comfort with Python libraries and basic data workflows.

Phase 2: Intermediate Understanding
Duration: 2-3 Months
Math Topics:

Linear Algebra: Eigenvalues, SVD

Probability & Statistics: Bayes’ theorem, hypothesis testing

Calculus: Partial derivatives, chain rule

Optimization: Gradient descent, learning rate tuning

Learning Focus:

Internal mechanics of algorithms (e.g., how logistic regression works).

Feature scaling, cross-validation, metrics (precision/recall, ROC-AUC).

Projects:

Algorithm Implementation:

Code logistic regression/k-NN from scratch in Python.

Model Tuning:

Hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV in scikit-learn).

Compare models (e.g., SVM vs. decision trees).

Goal:

Debug/tweak models mathematically.

Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Research/Industry)
Duration: 3-6 Months
Math Topics:

Vector Calculus: Jacobians, Hessians

Advanced Probability: Markov models, Poisson processes

Statistics: Bayesian inference

Deep Linear Algebra: Tensor operations

Learning Focus:

Neural networks (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs).

Frameworks: TensorFlow/PyTorch.

Concepts: Backpropagation, regularization (Dropout/L2), optimizers (Adam).

Projects:

Deep Learning:

CNN for image classification (CIFAR-10).

RNN for text generation/time-series forecasting.

Research Exploration:

Reproduce results from a seminal paper (e.g., ResNet, Transformers).

Build a mini-DL framework (autograd system).

Goal:

Contribute to research or deploy complex systems (e.g., object detection chatbots).

Resource Recommendations:
Math: 3Blue1Brown (YouTube), "Mathematics for Machine Learning" (book).

Python: Kaggle Micro-courses, scikit-learn documentation.

Deep Learning: fast.ai (practical), Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization (theory).

Key Principles:
Code Daily: Use GitHub to track projects.

Math First: Derive equations before coding.

Iterate: Start simple → add complexity (e.g., linear regression → polynomial → regularization).
